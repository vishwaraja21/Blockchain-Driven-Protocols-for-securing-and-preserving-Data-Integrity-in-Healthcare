# Blockchain-Driven-Protocols-for-securing-and-preserving-Data-Integrity-in-Healthcare

This project leverages blockchain and the MERN stack to ensure data integrity and security in healthcare. Blockchain provides decentralized, tamper-proof storage, preventing unauthorized modifications. Smart contracts on Ethereum automate data access control and authentication. The MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) enables efficient frontend-backend integration for seamless user interactions. This combination ensures secure, transparent, and immutable healthcare records.

## Features

- Secure and decentralized health data management
- Efficient health data sharing among healthcare providers
- Simple and intuitive UI design 
- Reliable data storage with Web3 Storage
- Seamless integration with Polygon blockchain

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Hardhat

- React.js

## Usage

1. Connect to a blockchain network using Metamask or another compatible wallet
2. Create a patient account
3. Add health records for the patient
4. Share the patient's health records with healthcare providers
